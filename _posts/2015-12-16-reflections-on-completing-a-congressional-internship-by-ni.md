**'Reflections on completing a Congressional Internship' by Nik Mendoza**

> "The duty of men is to be there, where he is most useful."- José Martí

I am so grateful and feel infinitely blessed to have had the opportunity to learn from a great American leader,[Congressman Mario Diaz-Balart][0]. Mario is a leader that has devoted a career of service for his community; is a strong friend of Latin America and Israel, and is an amazing human being, husband, and father. My experience in congress has been so special and enriching--words can't really describe. That an immigrant boy like me would reach this position is nothing short of a miracle, and a dream.

I am as inspired as I am challenged to keep working earnestly, to advance my studies, and to answer the call for leaders that our American Republic makes to those that are willing to respond. [José Martí][1], one of Mario's favorite writers, said it best: "The duty of men is to be there, where he is most useful."
